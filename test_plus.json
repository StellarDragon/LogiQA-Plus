Supporters believe that resurrected animals have the potential to restore the damaged ecological environment in certain areas. For example, mammoths live on the vast grasslands of Siberia, and their excrement is an excellent fertilizer for nourishing the grasslands. After the extinction of mammoths, the grasslands lacking fertilizers were gradually replaced by tundra. If mammoths can be revived and returned to Siberia, it will help reduce the area of the tundra and gradually restore the grassland ecosystem.",
